# Forecasting-Daily-Cash-Transactions-for-an-ATM
This project aims to forecast daily cash transactions for an ATM. The training data is in ds_exercise_data.csv file. It's a time series data. It includes 3 columns: CashIn, CashOut, and Date. <br>
- **CashIn** column contains the total deposit amount of the ATM for the given date.
- **CashOut** column contains the withdrawal values of given date on ATM.<br>
Using the data in ds_exercise_data.csv, forecastings will be done for the CashIn and CashOut values between 2019-04-01 and 2019-04-30.<br>

This project has 3 parts. 
   - First one is descriptive analysis. It includes data analysis implementations. It is important for understanding and interpreting data. There are some preprocessing operations and visulations inside it. 
<br>Second one is forecast with Prophet algorithm for cash in values. It includes operations about forecasting the CashIn values between 2019-04-01 and 2019-04-30. 
<br>Third one is again forecast with Prophet algorithm but this time itâ€™s to predict Cash Out values.<br>
<br>Predictions are in predictions.csv.</br>
